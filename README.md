This is a personal profile of myself built by using React. It is a single-page application. I included projects I worked on while attending coding bootcamp. 

## User Story

As an employer searching to an employee, I want to view a potential candidate's personal portfolio built with React. I will look for the employees skills and evaluate if qualified for a position.
